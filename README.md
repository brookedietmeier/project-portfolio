# University of Washington Informatics Portfolio (2021 - 2025) 
Hi, I‚Äôm **Brooke Dietmeier**, and this is my project portfolio showcasing the work I completed as part of the **Informatics Program at the University of Washington (2021‚Äì2025)**.  

Each project reflects my experience with data analysis, information management, and technology-driven problem solving, while addressing real-world challenges in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, and online communities.  

Through these projects, I developed skills in **SQL, Python, data visualization, research design, and web development**, while collaborating with peers to deliver impactful solutions. This portfolio highlights both technical implementations and applied research, demonstrating my ability to connect information science with practical applications.  

Explore the sections below to see my projects, repositories, and live applications.

## Senior Capstone
### Unmasking AI: AI Sycophancy & The Manosphere  
The rise of generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), presents new challenges in moderating online discourse‚Äîespecially within ideologically extreme digital spaces such as the manosphere. This research investigates how LLMs respond to both overt and coded misogynistic rhetoric when framed by personas derived from four manosphere subcultures: incels, pickup artists (PUAs), looksmaxxers, and men‚Äôs rights advocates (MRA). Using a quantitative approach that combines Reddit scraping via ArcticShift, natural language processing with Empath, sentiment analysis using HuggingFace‚Äôs transformers pipeline, and simulated AI personas with Groq LLaMA 3.3 and Gemma 2, we examine the extent to which LLMs reinforce, neutralize, or challenge misogynistic narratives depending on the prompt's rhetorical style and user identity. By highlighting the nuances in AI responses across different personas and prompt styles, this study aims to expose critical gaps in current AI safety measures and recommends targeted interventions to mitigate the amplification of toxic content in male-dominated online ecosystems.

This project explores the research question: How do different generative AI systems respond to coded and explicit misogynistic rhetoric drawn from the manosphere, and to what extent do these systems reinforce, neutralize, or challenge these narratives depending on the prompting persona? To investigate this, we simulate user interactions by developing distinct AI personas modeled after each of the four manosphere subcultures: incels, pickup artists, looksmaxxers, and men‚Äôs rights advocates. These personas allow us to test how various LLMs respond to differing rhetorical framings and user identities, ranging from passive inquiry to overtly misogynistic discourse.

Through this inquiry, we aim to:
1.) Evaluate how different AI systems interpret both overt and coded forms of misogyny depending on the simulated user identity
2.) Identify gaps in current AI safety frameworks for developers to propose interventions to reduce the amplification of toxic content.

## Informatics Projects

### [Info 201] Final Project - Data Analysis
Project Overview: Exploring the Dynamics of Poverty and Obesity in the United States

This project investigates the relationship between poverty/wealth and obesity in the United States. Through analysis of combined data from Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and National Obesity by State published by the CDC, we aim to shed light on several critical questions surrounding this topic.

### [Info 310] Information Assurances and Cybersecurity - Securing Password Manager Application
Our team secured a web application during a project for an Information Assurances and Cybersecurity class. Initially, the web application was vulnerable to various attacks, including SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). My team and I led the effort to secure the application by implementing multiple layers of security measures. We transitioned the application from HTTP to HTTPS, enhanced authentication by switching to session IDs, implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and secured the MySQL database with parameterized queries and input sanitization. These efforts resulted in a robustly secured web application, demonstrating my technical proficiency and commitment to cybersecurity.

### [Info 442] Cooperative Software Development - CyberQuest
Over the course of 10 weeks, our team developed a web application designed to provide accessible cybersecurity learning resources, guidance, and career exploration opportunities for undergraduate students at the University of Washington. Our goal was to address the question: "How might we improve access to entry-level cybersecurity education for students in the Seattle area to help them build foundational skills and knowledge in cybersecurity?"
