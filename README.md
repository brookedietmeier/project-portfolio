This project investigates the relationship between poverty/wealth and obesity in the United States. Through analysis of combined data from Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and National Obesity by State published by the CDC, we aim to shed light on several critical questions surrounding this topic.

### [Info 310] Information Assurances and Cybersecurity - Securing Password Manager Application
Our team secured a web application during a project for an Information Assurances and Cybersecurity class. Initially, the web application was vulnerable to various attacks, including SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). My team and I led the effort to secure the application by implementing multiple layers of security measures. We transitioned the application from HTTP to HTTPS, enhanced authentication by switching to session IDs, implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and secured the MySQL database with parameterized queries and input sanitization. These efforts resulted in a robustly secured web application, demonstrating my technical proficiency and commitment to cybersecurity.
